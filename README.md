# Swolely Grail :muscle: 
Swolely Grail is a mobile-responsive application that allows users to create custom workout routines and track their progress to help build a healthier, happier self.

## How Does It Work?
Users visit the home page and create an account. From there, users logged in can make a routine, and insert their progress during each workout. The application can work both on your computer as well as mobile device.

## Clone Repo To Your Machine
- Have MongoDB and Meteor set up on your laptop. (_If you're unfamiliar with how to download either, Google will be your best friend!_)
- Once you are set up, cd into this repo via Terminal and run ```meteor npm install```. This will place the ```node_modules``` folder at the root of your project and modify the ```package.json``` at the root of this application.
- Next, ``run meteor`` in Terminal to allow the application to run
- To view the app in your browser, visit ```localhost:3000``` and VOILA!
